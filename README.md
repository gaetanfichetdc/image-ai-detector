# AI vs Real Image Classifier

This project trains a deep learning model to distinguish between **AI-generated images** and **real images** using transfer learning.  
It is designed as a portfolio project to showcase skills in data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and interpretability with Grad-CAM.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Project Goals
- Build a binary classifier that predicts whether an image is **REAL** or **FAKE (AI-generated)**.  
- Use **transfer learning** with a pretrained ResNet-18 to achieve strong performance with limited training time.  
- Explore **interpretability** using Grad-CAM heatmaps to visualize what regions of an image influence the modelâ€™s decision.  
- Provide a reproducible notebook that others can run to reproduce the results.

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset
The dataset used is **CIFAKE: Real and AI-Generated Synthetic Images**, available on Kaggle:  
ðŸ‘‰ [CIFAKE dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/birdy654/cifake-real-and-ai-generated-synthetic-images?resource=download)  

- **REAL images**: taken from the CIFAR-10 dataset (natural images).  
- **FAKE images**: generated using a latent diffusion model to mimic CIFAR-10 classes.  
- The dataset is balanced, with ~60k real and ~60k synthetic images.
